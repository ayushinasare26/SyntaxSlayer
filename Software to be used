1. AI & Computer Vision Software
      These handle vehicle detection, classification, and density estimation.
      
      Python – Main programming language for AI logic.
      
      OpenCV – For frame extraction, preprocessing, ROI masking, and visualization.
      
      YOLOv8 / YOLOv5 (via Ultralytics) – Real-time object detection.
      
      TensorFlow or PyTorch – For training or fine-tuning models.
      
      NumPy / Pandas – For handling detection data and traffic metrics.

2. Video Streaming & Processing
      FFmpeg – For handling live CCTV video streams.
      
      RTSP Protocol – For receiving camera feed directly.
      
      GStreamer – (Optional) for optimized streaming pipelines.

3. Traffic Control Software
      Arduino IDE – If using Arduino to control lights.
      
      Raspberry Pi OS + Python GPIO – If using Raspberry Pi for direct signal control.
      
      PLC Programming Software (e.g., Siemens TIA Portal) – If using industrial controllers.

4. Data Storage & Backend
      MySQL / PostgreSQL – For storing traffic density logs, violation data.
      
      SQLite – Lightweight option if logging locally on edge devices.

5. Dashboard & Monitoring
      Flask or Django – For creating a web dashboard to monitor traffic data.
      
      Grafana – For real-time analytics & visualization.
      
      HTML/CSS/JavaScript – For custom dashboard front-end.

6. Optional ANPR (Violation Detection)
      OpenALPR or EasyOCR – For automatic number plate recognition.
      
      Tesseract OCR – For text recognition in license plates.
